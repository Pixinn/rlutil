rlutil======_RLUTIL_ is simple utility collection to aid the creation of cross-platformconsole-mode roguelike games with C++ and C. At least that was the original idea.In reality, it mostly just contains functions to position and colorize text as well asreading keyboard input.**This is a fork of the original project, providing a CMakeList.txt and an install target.**The original *rlutil* can be found here:  [https://github.com/tapio/rlutil](https://github.com/tapio/rlutil)## QUICK START ##Just copy the *include* directory in your project and `#include "include/rlutil.h"` in your source code. It automagically detects if youare using C++ or C and adjusts the code accordingly (e.g. `std::string` vs. `char*`).## INSTALLATION ##You can build and install a CMake package:    		$ cmake --build . --target installOn Windows, you need to set the environment variable *CMAKE_PACKAGES_DIR* to the directory where you usually install cmake packages.## DOCUMENTATION ##See the API reference in [docs/HTML/](docs/HTML/index.html "API Reference")or the source code comments for documentation.## DOWNLOAD ##You can download this project in either[zip](https://github.com/Pixinn/rlutil/zipball/master "zip") or[tar](https://github.com/Pixinn/rlutil/tarball/master "tar") formats.You can also clone the project with [Git](https://git-scm.com "Git") by running:    $ git clone https://github.com/Pixinn/rlutil.git## LICENSE ##See [docs/License.txt][] or [API Documentation][].[docs/License.txt]: docs/License.txt "Raw license text"[API Documentation]: docs/HTML/files/docs/License-txt.html "HTML license text"
